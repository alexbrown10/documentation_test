# Alex's Documentation Deployment Test

This is a quick example of a documentation hub deployed via [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), that was deployed in ~30 minutes. 

Changes made to the Github repo are automatically processed via Github Actions to be deployed to the [main hosted site](https://alexbrown10.github.io/documentation_test/). 

There is a wide range of customization options available, as described on the main Material for MKDocs [Customization Page](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/), so further CSS, Javascript, design, and layout options can be explored.
